## I. Scope of Processing of Personal Data

We only process personal data of our users if this is necessary to provide a functional website and if this is required to make our contents and services available. The processing of personal data of our users takes place as a rule only after consent of the user. An exception applies in those cases where prior consent cannot be obtained for factual reasons and the processing of the data is permitted under statutory regulations.

## II. Data Erasure and Duration of Storage

The personal data of the data subject will be erased or made unavailable as soon as the purpose of storage ceases to apply. Furthermore, data may be stored if this has been provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other ordinances to which the responsible person is subject. The data will also be made unavailable or erased if a storage period prescribed by the named norms expires, unless the continued storage of the data is necessary for the conclusion or fulfillment of a contract.

## III. Provision of the Website and Creation of Log Files

### 1. Description and scope of data processing

Each time our website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and information from the computer system of the accessing computer.

The following data are collected here:

- Date and time of access

The data are also stored in the log files of our system. A storage of this data together with other personal data of the user does not take place.

### 2. Purpose and legal basis for data processing

Information about the collection and use of your data on YouTube can be found [here](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de&gl=de).

## VI. Web Analytics

### Scope of processing of personal data

TU Dortmund University uses the open-source software tool Matomo (formerly PIWIK) to improve its websites by analyzing the surfing behavior of its users. The software works with digital fingerprints which assign online activities to a single browser session and are deleted after 24 hours. Matomo does not use cookies.

The following data are saved when individual pages of our website are accessed:

1. Two bytes of the IP address of the accessing user system
2. The accessed website
3. The website from which the user accessed the requested page (referrer)
4. The sub-pages which are accessed from the visited website
5. The time spent on the webpage
6. Which browser with which plug-ins, which operating system and which screen resolution is used

The software only runs on our website servers. The users’ personal data is only saved to the website server and not shared with third parties.

Preventing data recording

You can prevent the above-mentioned recording of data by activating the "Do-not-track" setting in your browser. Our Matomo system is configured to respect this setting.

## VII. Contact/Suggestion Forms and E-mail Contact
