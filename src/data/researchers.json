His research focuses on the safety and security of intelligent and autonomous software systems. He is particularly interested in the use of  formal methods to analyze the behavior of such systems. After studying computer science and earning his doctorate at TU Dortmund University, Falk Howar first worked in the USA at Carnegie Mellon University (Silicon Valley) and at NASA Ames Research Center, where he developed methods for testing an autonomous air traffic control system. Subsequently, he was on the management board of the Institute for Applied Software Systems Engineering at TU Clausthal. There, he conducted research on safe autonomous driving functions together with partners from the automotive industry."
