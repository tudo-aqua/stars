# STARS Documentation

This space renders Markdown and MDX files stored in `src/content/docs`. Add new files or folders and they will appear automatically in the sidebar under `/docs/`.

- Place `index.md` in any folder to make that folder's landing page.
- Use the `order` frontmatter field to control sorting among siblings.
- The sidebar is generated from the folder structure; no manual menus are required.
